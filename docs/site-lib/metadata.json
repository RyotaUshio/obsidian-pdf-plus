href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/14jq9by/obsidian_136_adds_deep_linking_to_pdf_selections/\" target=\"_self\">PDF deep linking feature introduced in Obsidian v1.3.6</a>.To better understand how PDF++'s backlink highlighting works, let's start by disabling the plugin and taking a look at Obsidian's native PDF support.Open a PDF file in your vault, select a range of text and then right-click.\nObsidian will show you a context menu. From there, click \"Copy link to selection\".<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240224150625.png\" src=\"attachments/pasted-image-20240224150625.png\" target=\"_self\">\nIt will copy a link that looks like [[Lorem Ipsum.pdf#page=1&amp;selection=4,0,4,11|Lorem Ipsum, page 1]], clicking which will take you to the exact location in the PDF file where you copied the link from.However, it doesn't work in the opposite way. While jumping to a text selection in a PDF from a markdown file works like a charm, you can't go to the markdown file linking to the text selection.\nAlso, it is difficult to see what parts of the PDF are referenced in your notes at a glance.Here's where PDF++ comes in.Now, enable the plugin. You will find the text that you linked to in the previous step is displayed with a highlight. It makes it easy to identify the text selections with backlinks.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240224153532.png\" src=\"attachments/pasted-image-20240224153532.png\" target=\"_self\">You can easily open the backlink, i.e. go back to the specific location in the markdown file that links to the text selection, by double-clicking the highlight.What's more, hovering over the highlight with the Ctrl/Cmd key pressed (by default) will show you a popover preview of the backlink.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240224160002.png\" src=\"attachments/pasted-image-20240224160002.png\" target=\"_self\">Note <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Page+preview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Page+preview\" target=\"_self\">Page preview</a> is required to be enabled.\nIf you prefer not to press Ctrl/Cmd while hovering over highlights to see popover previews, go to the Page preview settings and turn off the toggle switch named \"PDF++ hover action\".\nWhen hovering over a highlight, you can open the backlink instead of triggering popover previews if you want to; see PDF++ settings for the details. <br>Next: <a data-href=\"Backlink highlighting - Colors\" href=\"backlink-highlighting-colors.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Backlink highlighting - Colors</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Backlink highlighting - Basics","level":1,"id":"Backlink highlighting - Basics"},{"heading":"Reviewing Obsidian's native PDF support","level":2,"id":"Reviewing_Obsidian's_native_PDF_support"},{"heading":"Introducing backlink highlighting","level":2,"id":"Introducing_backlink_highlighting"},{"heading":"Open backlinks from PDFs","level":3,"id":"Open_backlinks_from_PDFs"},{"heading":"Popover previews","level":3,"id":"Popover_previews"}],"links":["backlink-highlighting-colors.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"backlink-highlighting-basics.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":["attachments/pasted-image-20240224150625.html","attachments/pasted-image-20240224153532.html","attachments/screen-recording-2024-02-24-at-15.51.47.html","attachments/pasted-image-20240224160002.html"],"createdTime":1709054392882,"modifiedTime":1709054392882,"sourceSize":2336,"sourcePath":"Backlink highlighting - Basics.md","exportPath":"backlink-highlighting-basics.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"backlink-highlighting-colors.html":{"title":"Backlink highlighting - Colors","icon":"","description":"Learn how to customize highlight colors.Recall that you copied a link that looks like the following in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Backlink highlighting - Basics\" data-href=\"Backlink highlighting - Basics\" href=\"backlink-highlighting-basics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">previous tutorial</a>:[[Lorem Ipsum.pdf#page=1&amp;selection=4,0,4,11|Lorem Ipsum, page 1]]\nCopy<br>By default, PDF++ converts this link to a yellow highlight (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Settings/Backlink highlighting > Default highlight color\" data-href=\"Settings/Backlink highlighting#Default highlight color\" href=\"settings/backlink-highlighting.html#Default_highlight_color\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">related setting</a>). To change the color, append &amp;color=&lt;COLOR NAME&gt; to the link text.

A dummy PDF file acts as a proxy for an actual PDF file that lives outside your vault.A dummy PDF file is a plain text file that\nhas an extension .pdf,\ncontains only a single URL/URI, which starts with https://, http:// (for PDFs on the web) or with file:/// (for local PDFs), and\n(tentative; may change) is 300 bytes or smaller.\nNote\nFor file:///, notice there are three slash signs.\n<br>Don't worry, there are also <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"How to create dummy files easily\" data-href=\"#How to create dummy files easily\" href=\"external-pdf-files.html#How_to_create_dummy_files_easily\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">easier ways</a> - but let's create a dummy PDF file manually just to get the idea.For example, open your favorite text editor and create a text file with the following content:https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf\nCopyThen, save it as example.pdf.Note\nAgain, a dummy PDF file is just a plain text file although the extension .pdf looks as if it were an actual PDF file.\n<br>Open example.pdf in Obsidian. Then, the following PDF file will be displayed in the built-in PDF viewer: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf\" target=\"_self\">https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf</a>.<br>It looks as if a normal PDF file located in your vault, and various PDF-related features work the same - you can copy a link to a text selection, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Embedding rectangular selections\" data-href=\"Embedding rectangular selections\" href=\"embedding-rectangular-selections.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">embed a rectangular selection</a>, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Backlink highlighting - Basics\" data-href=\"Backlink highlighting - Basics\" href=\"backlink-highlighting-basics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">highlight backlinks</a>, and so on.PDF++ offers several ways to make the creation of dummy files easier: with drag &amp; drop, via a command, and by a bookmarklet.While holding Shift (by default), drag and drop a PDF file from your OS's file manager (Finder, File Explorer, etc.), or from your browser, to Obsidian's editor to create a dummy file and insert a link to it.<br>You can customize which modifier key to use (or not to use any key) in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"obsidian://pdf-plus?setting=modifierToDropExternalPDFToCreateDummy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"obsidian:/pdf-plus?setting=modifierToDropExternalPDFToCreateDummy\" target=\"_self\">settings</a>.

Note that on mobile, you might need to start holding Shift (or any modifier key you choose in the setting) before dragging.You can also create dummy files using the PDF++: Create dummy file for external PDF command.You can create a bookmarklet for quickly creating dummy files from your browser.<br>\nSee here for the details: <a data-href=\"Bookmarklet to create dummy PDF files\" href=\"bookmarklet-to-create-dummy-pdf-files.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bookmarklet to create dummy PDF files</a>.<br>You can specified the default save location of dummy PDF files in the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"obsidian://pdf-plus?setting=dummyFileFolderPath\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"obsidian:/pdf-plus?setting=dummyFileFolderPath\" target=\"_self\">settings</a>. By default, they are saved in the same folder as Obsidian's attachment folder (Obsidian Settings &gt; Files and links &gt; Default location for new attachments). You can also choose a different folder. For example, using a dedicated folder for dummy PDF files might be helpful for later file management.There is one thing you cannot do for external PDF files: editing/modification; external PDFs are read-only in some sense.\nMoreover, the loading speed might also be an issue if the PDF is fetched from the Internet.To resolve these problems, you can \"import\" an external PDF file into your vault.\nIt means that the actual binary content of the external PDF is saved in the dummy PDF.\nThe dummy PDF is no longer a dummy, but instead, it's now an actual PDF file.There are two ways to import an external PDF file:\nClick the Import external PDF into vault button () in the PDF toolbar. Run the command PDF++: Import this PDF into vault\nRun the Open this PDF in the original location command while opening an external PDF file to open it in the original location.\nIf it's in the local file system, the OS-defined default PDF viewer will be opened. If it's on the web, the browser will open the original file.Note that dummy PDF files do not follow the PDF specification and thus cannot be recognized by other PDF viewer applications such as Adobe Acrobat.\nIf PDF++ stops working, they will not displayed properly even in Obsidian.However, they are just plain text files so you can easily open them with any text editor, and then replace them with actual PDF files.It is pretty easy to distinguish dummy &amp; actual PDFs because the actual ones always start with a string of the form \"%PDF-x.y\". It is trivial to write a tiny script (in Python or whatever language) that checks if a given PDF file is a dummy or not. Even if you don't know how to code, you can just open the file as a plain text file using any text editor to check its content. In practice, you will also be able to use file sizes because dummy PDFs are &lt;= 300 bytes, which is a unusually small size for PDFs.<br>Note\nThe icon was taken from <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://lucide.dev/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://lucide.dev/\" target=\"_self\">Lucide</a>.

For example:\nWikilink style: [[file title|display text]]\nMarkdown link style: [display text](file%20title)\nFor PDF text selections or annotations, Obsidian uses the display text of the form {{file.basename}}, page {{page}} by default. You can change it to whatever format you want in the plugin settings:<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240226025524.png\" src=\"attachments/pasted-image-20240226025524.png\" target=\"_self\">For example, Page number only: page {{page}}\nMake it even more compact: p.{{page}}\n<br>Use <a data-href=\"Page labels\" href=\"page-labels.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Page labels</a> instead of page numbers: page {{pageLabel}} or p.{{pageLabel}}\nUse the selected text as the display text: {{text}}\n<br>Use a property from <a data-href=\"a markdown file associated with the PDF file\" href=\"a markdown file associated with the PDF file\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a markdown file associated with the PDF file</a> if available: {{properties.title ?? filename.basename}}, p.{{pageLabel}}\nAs you might have already noticed if you're familiar with JavaScript, each {{...}} is evaluated as a JavaScript expression. It means you can do whatever you want in your templates!Don't worry even if you have no experience with JavaScript; PDF++ prepares almost all information you will want in your templates for you and make it availabel as various preset variables so that you don't have to do anything too complex.<br>Learn more at: <a data-href=\"Templating\" href=\"templating.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Templating</a>.<br>Prefer page labels to page numbers\nUsing page labels helps you make your notes more robust to PDF page reorganization such as insertion, deletion or extraction.

Why?Let's say you have a 300-page PDF of a textbook. For the sake of loading speed or sync performance, you might want to split this PDF into\nsmaller parts (e.g. chapters or sections).\nPDF++ offers a command that allows you to do this and auto-update the page numbers in all related links ([[file.pdf#page=&lt;PAGE_NUMBER&gt;]]) at the same time so that they can keep pointing to the correct destination pages.However, it does NOT update the display texts ([[file.pdf#page=1|&lt;DISPLAY_TEXT&gt;]]).\nAs a result, if you choose the update strategy when splitting the PDF or use raw page indices (the page template variable) in your display text templates, the display texts will become inconsistent with the updated document even though the link text itself will be updated accordingly.You can avoid this pitfall as follows:\nA PDF file does not necessarily come with page labels out of the box. So, when you import a PDF file into your vault, first check if it has page labels. You can check it by looking at the page number counter in the PDF toolbar as I explained earlier.\nIf it doesn't, manually set page numbers with the PDF++ command \"Edit page labels\".\nObsidian's default format is {{file.basename}}, page {{page}}.\nIt is not very ideal because it contains the raw page number (page), which will be obsolete once a page reorganization such as insertion, deletion, or extraction takes place.Instead, I recommend to use page labels, like so {{file.basename}}, page {{pageLabel}}.It ensures the page labels won't change (and hence the display text won't become outdated) even after the page manipulation (insertion etc).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Page labels","level":1,"id":"Page labels"},{"heading":"PDF page composer","level":2,"id":"PDF_page_composer"},{"heading":"1.
