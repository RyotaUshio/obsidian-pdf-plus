Thank you for considering contributing to this plugin!
Before proceeding, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

### General Guidelines

- Create an issue before submitting a pull request (except for trivial bug fixes or typo corrections). This helps us discuss your proposal before any major work is done.

### Licensing & Revenue Considerations

- This project might become a paid product in the future. If that happens, contributors might not receive a share of the revenue unless thereâ€™s a separate agreement. By contributing, you acknowledge and accept this.
- However, this does not exclude the possibility of revenue sharing through GitHub Sponsors or other means, at the discretion of the project maintainers, for contributors who are deemed to have made significant contributions.
