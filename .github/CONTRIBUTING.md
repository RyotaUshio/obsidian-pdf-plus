### General Guidelines

Create an issue before submitting a pull request. This helps us discuss your proposal before any major work is done.

### How to build the plugin

### Licensing & Revenue Considerations

This project might become a paid product in the future. If that happens, contributors might not receive a share of the revenue unless thereâ€™s a separate agreement. By contributing, you acknowledge and accept this.

However, this does not exclude the possibility of revenue sharing through GitHub Sponsors or other means, at the discretion of the project maintainers, for contributors who are deemed to have made significant contributions.
