> This is an **experimental** feature.

With PDF++, you can seamlessly integrate PDF files located **outside your vault** as if they were inside.

For example, PDF++ allows Obsidian's built-in PDF viewer to open PDF files **from the Internet** or **located externally on your local file system**. 
Backlink highlighting works consistently across all PDFs, regardless of their location within or outside the vault.

Thanks to this feature, you can manage PDF files without saving their actual contents in your vault folder. As a result, you don't need to worry about the storage limit of Obsidian Sync anymore, for example.

> [!NOTE]
> For local PDF files, use symbolic links instead if possible.

## Dummy PDF files

PDF++ uses "dummy" PDF files to achieve these functionalities. A dummy PDF file acts as a proxy for an actual PDF file that lives outside your vault.

A dummy PDF file is a plain text file that
- has an extension `.pdf`,
- contains only a single URL/URI, which starts with `https://`, `http://` (for PDFs on the web) or with `file:///` (for local PDFs), and
- (tentative; may change) is 300 bytes or smaller.

> [!NOTE]
> For `file:///`, notice there are **three** slash signs.

### Create a dummy file manually

Don't worry, there are also [[#How to create dummy files easily|easier ways]] - but let's create a dummy PDF file manually just to get the idea.

For example, open your favorite text editor and create a text file with the following content:

```
https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf
```

Then, save it as `example.pdf`.

> [!NOTE]
> Again, a dummy PDF file is just a plain text file although the extension `.pdf` looks as if it were an actual PDF file.

Open `example.pdf` in Obsidian. Then, the following PDF file will be displayed in the built-in PDF viewer: https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf.

It looks as if a normal PDF file located in your vault, and various PDF-related features work the same - you can copy a link to a text selection, [[Embedding rectangular selections|embed a rectangular selection]], [[Backlink highlighting - Basics|highlight backlinks]], and so on.

### How to create dummy files easily

PDF++ offers several ways to make the creation of dummy files easier: with drag & drop, via a command, and by a bookmarklet.

#### Drag & drop

While holding `Shift` (by default), drag and drop a PDF file from your OS's file manager (Finder, File Explorer, etc.), or from your browser, to Obsidian's editor to create a dummy file and insert a link to it.

You can customize which modifier key to use (or not to use any key) in the [settings](obsidian://pdf-plus?setting=modifierToDropExternalPDFToCreateDummy). By choosing "None" or `Option` (macOS) / `Ctrl` (other), you can override [Obsidian's built-in drag-and-drop actions](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Drag+and+drop#Dragging%20from%20outside%20Obsidian) if you want to.

##### Dragging from Finder/File Explorer

Note that this does not work on mobile.

##### Dragging links from a browser

Dragging from your browser will work whether you are on a desktop or mobile device like an iPad. Note that on mobile, you might need to start holding `Shift` (or any modifier key you choose in the setting) before dragging.

##### Dragging from a browser's URL bar

#### Command

You can also create dummy files using the **PDF++: Create dummy file for external PDF** command.

#### Bookmarklet

You can create a bookmarklet for quickly creating dummy files from your browser.
See here for the details: [[Bookmarklet to create dummy PDF files]].


## Where to save dummy files

You can specified the default save location of dummy PDF files in the [settings](obsidian://pdf-plus?setting=dummyFileFolderPath). By default, they are saved in the same folder as Obsidian's attachment folder (Obsidian Settings > Files and links > Default location for new attachments). 

You can also choose a different folder. For example, using a dedicated folder for dummy PDF files might be helpful for later file management.

## Importing external PDFs

There is one thing you cannot do for external PDF files: editing/modification; external PDFs are read-only in some sense.
Moreover, the loading speed might also be an issue if the PDF is fetched from the Internet.

To resolve these problems, you can "import" an external PDF file into your vault.
It means that the actual binary content of the external PDF is saved in the dummy PDF.
The dummy PDF is no longer a dummy, but instead, it's now an actual PDF file.

There are two ways to import an external PDF file:
- Click the **Import external PDF into vault** button (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-import"><path d="M12 3v12"/><path d="m8 11 4 4 4-4"/><path d="M8 5H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v10a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h16a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7a2 2 0 0 0-2-2h-4"/></svg>) in the PDF toolbar. 
- Run the command **PDF++: Import this PDF into vault**

## Opening external PDFs in their original locations

Run the **Open this PDF in the original location** command while opening an external PDF file to open it in the original location.
If it's in the local file system, the OS-defined default PDF viewer will be opened. If it's on the web, the browser will open the original file.

## Future-proofness

Note that dummy PDF files do not follow the PDF specification and thus cannot be recognized by other PDF viewer applications such as Adobe Acrobat.
If PDF++ stops working, they will not displayed properly even in Obsidian.

However, they are just plain text files so you can easily open them with any text editor, and then replace them with actual PDF files.

It is pretty easy to distinguish dummy & actual PDFs because the actual ones always start with a string of the form "%PDF-x.y". It is trivial to write a tiny script (in Python or whatever language) that checks if a given PDF file is a dummy or not. Even if you don't know how to code, you can just open the file as a plain text file using any text editor to check its content. In practice, you will also be able to use file sizes because dummy PDFs are <= 300 bytes, which is a unusually small size for PDFs.
