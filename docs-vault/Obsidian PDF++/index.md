> [!important] Support Development
> It is not an easy work to develop and maintain this plugin; it requires investigating Obsidian's unexposed internals, the knowledge of the technical specification of the PDF file format and PDF-related libraries, and more.
> 
> Therefore, **your financial support is crucial for ensuring PDF++ can help you organize your knowledge base for the years to come.**
